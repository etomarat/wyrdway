In addition to desktop and mobile operating systems, TIC-80 can run in some handhelds via [RetroArch](https://www.retroarch.com/) / libretro.

At the moment, these are the handhelds / operating systems that are known to work:

- [Miyoo Mini Plus](https://miyoo.aliexpress.com/), via [Onion OS](https://onionui.github.io/) (more details: <https://onionui.github.io/docs/emulators/tic-80>)
  - Performance is not great, but simple games are playable. As a benchmark, "8 Bit Panda" suffers from garbled sound and FPS slowdowns.
- All devices supported by [ROCKNIX](https://rocknix.org/) (more details: <https://rocknix.org/systems/tic-80/>). In particular, the following devices have been tested and are known to work: Powkiddy RGB30.
  - Performance is highly variable, depending on the device. Some devices can run games at full speed, while others struggle to maintain 60 FPS. "8 Bit Panda" runs at full speed on the Powkiddy RGB30, while [Emuurom](https://www.emuurom.com/) crashes on launch.
- All devices supported by [ArkOS](https://github.com/christianhaitian/arkos) (more details: <https://github.com/christianhaitian/arkos/wiki/ArkOS-Emulators-and-Ports-information#tic-80>)
  - Performance is highly variable, depending on the device. Some devices can run games at full speed, while others struggle to maintain 60 FPS.
- [TrimUI Smart Pro](http://trimui.com/), via [CrossMix-OS](https://github.com/cizia64/CrossMix-OS), [Tomato OS](https://github.com/jutleys/Trimui-Smart-Tomato) or manual installation of the TIC-80 core in RetroArch.
  - Performance is reasonable. "8 Bit Panda" runs at full speed, but more complex games like [Emuurom](https://www.emuurom.com/) suffer from audio stutter and FPS slowdowns.

If you know of any other handhelds that can run TIC-80 via RetroArch / libretro, please let us know so we can keep this list up to date.

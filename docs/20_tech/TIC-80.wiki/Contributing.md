This page is intended to provide many ideas for possible contributions to the TIC-80 project, whatever the time or the level of expertise you have.

📖: **little to no prior knowledge**.  
🕑: **little time investment**.  

## Content Curation
This part is accessible to everyone, requires no investment and is already very useful since it is most often lacking.

📖 🕑 Test and like carts on the [official website](tic80.com) to showcase the ones that will appeal most to the community. A cart needs two likes to appear on the home page.

📖 🕑 When you encounter a problem and you notice there already is an open issue about it, always like the issue!

📖 🕑 Read other [issues](https://github.com/nesbox/TIC-80/issues) and like the issues you feel are most important to the community or easiest to fix. That will help other contributors prioritize.  
You can start with:
- the issues reporting a bug, with the ["bug" label](https://github.com/nesbox/TIC-80/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Abug).
- the issues on a specific part of the project you think needs improvement, for example the [code editor](https://github.com/nesbox/TIC-80/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22editor%3A+code%22).
- the issues that already have at least one like ([Issues](https://github.com/nesbox/TIC-80/issues) → Sort → :+1: or :heart:).
- the issues that are on the TODO list of the latest [project](https://github.com/nesbox/TIC-80/projects). Some can be pushed back with release.

Restrain from liking complex features that would make the project more difficult to maintain.

## Report Issues

Report a bug or request a new feature on our [issues](https://github.com/nesbox/TIC-80/issues) page.

📖 🕑 If you don't need the Pro version, you can work with the [nightly builds](https://nightly.link/nesbox/TIC-80/workflows/build/main) in order to spot bugs before the next release. Update with the latest build from time to time.

📖 Using the nightly builds you can also actively test the [latest modifications](https://github.com/nesbox/TIC-80/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed) of the code, looking for bugs.

## Contribute to the Wiki
Review or improve our [wiki](https://github.com/nesbox/TIC-80/wiki).

Here are suggestions on how to find what to improve:
- Check that the additions of the [latest release](https://github.com/nesbox/TIC-80/releases) have been implemented to the wiki.
- Improve the [Beginner's Tips](https://github.com/nesbox/TIC-80/wiki/Beginners'-Tips) page, especially if you are new to TIC-80.
- 📖 When you struggle understanding something on the wiki, others will struggle too: Open an [issue](https://github.com/nesbox/TIC-80/issues) to ask for clarifications/improvement of the wiki page, explain what is not clear to you.
- Take a look at questions from the community on [discord](https://discord.gg/HwZDw7n4dN), [telegram](https://t.me/tic80) or elsewhere and improve the wiki to have them answered.
- Improve the [Music Editor](https://github.com/nesbox/TIC-80/wiki/Music-editor) documentation to answer [these questions](https://github.com/nesbox/TIC-80/issues/2153).
- Write a [tutorial](https://github.com/nesbox/TIC-80/wiki/tutorials), adapt a Lua tutorial to Python (or any other language you like) or 📖 add a tutorial you've found. In particular, you can add [non-English tutorials](https://github.com/nesbox/TIC-80/wiki/Tutorials#non-english-tutorials) if you speak other languages.
- Add your [code snippets](https://github.com/nesbox/TIC-80/wiki/code-examples-and-snippets).
- 📖 Not all contributors of the wiki are fluent in English, do not hesitate to rephrase or correct something.

## Help Others
Help others with their code or questions about the project.

You will find active communities on the [discord](https://discord.gg/HwZDw7n4dN) and [telegram](https://t.me/tic80).

🕑 The [itch.io community](https://nesbox.itch.io/tic80/community) and github [discussions](https://github.com/nesbox/TIC-80/discussions) are not so active, questions are rarer but can remain unanswered. You can subscribe to notifications there to prevent this.  
For the github discussions the subscription to notification is on the github [main page](https://github.com/nesbox/TIC-80) → watch → custom → discussion.

Recurrent questions can suggest that the wiki needs clarification on this topic.

## Contribute to the Code
If you have the capabilities to contribute to the code, your help is precious!  
Create [pull requests](https://github.com/nesbox/TIC-80/pulls) with the changes you want to make.

If you want ideas of what contributions to add, you can:

- look at the issues [labelled with "bug"](https://github.com/nesbox/TIC-80/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Abug).
- sort the issues by [number of likes](https://github.com/nesbox/TIC-80/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Areactions-%2B1-desc) to find out what the community is expecting the most.  
- the code editor still needs improvements, look at the [related issues](https://github.com/nesbox/TIC-80/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22editor%3A+code%22).
